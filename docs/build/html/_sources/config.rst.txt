Configuration
=============

Whenever you want to run RetroDetector to analyze the data for a new project, you need to set up a configuration file to tell RetroDetector where to find the reference genome, reference transcriptome, and whole genome sequencing files. 

Make sure you are in your working directory and then copy the example config.yaml file from the RetroDetector installation location to your current directory. 

.. code-block:: console

  cp /users/software/RetroDetector/example/config.yaml .
