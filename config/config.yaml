#Advanced parameters

#A supporting overlapping alignment must extend at least junction_overhang base pairs on both sides of an exon-exon junction
junction_overhang: 10

#A supporting overlapping alignment must have no more than insertions_threshold insertions (in the region comprised of the junction_overhang base pairs on either side of an exon-exon junction)
insertions_threshold: 10

#Each read of the pair in a supporting short-read spanning alignment must include short_read_spanning_alignment_minimum_matching_bp matches in its cigar string 
#For example, by default, each read of the pair must have at least 30 bases marked as matches in its cigar string
short_read_spanning_alignment_minimum_matching_bp: 30

#For a supporting short-read spanning alignment, we require the transcriptomic insertion size to be between 
#short_read_spanning_alignment_minimum_transcriptomic_insertion_size and short_read_spanning_alignment_maximum_transcriptomic_insertion_size
short_read_spanning_alignment_minimum_transcriptomic_insertion_size: 215
short_read_spanning_alignment_maximum_transcriptomic_insertion_size: 485

#For a given paired short-read alignment to the transcriptome, we define the expected genomic insertion size as follows:
#We take the insertion size of the transcript alignment and then add the lengths of any spanned introns.
#For example, if the leftmost transcript coordinate of the left read is 101
#and the rightmost transcript coordinate of the right read is 500
#then the insertion size of the transcript alignment is 400
#If there is an exon-exon junction at coordinate 200 that corresponds to an intron of length 25
#and there is an exon-exon junction at coordinate 300 that corresponds to an intron of length 50
#then the corresponding expected genomic insertion size would be 400 + 25 + 50 = 475.
#In order to consider a supporting short-read spanning alignment as "strong" support,
#we require that the expected genomic insertion size is at least short_read_strong_spanning_alignment_expected_genomic_insertion_size_threshold
short_read_strong_spanning_alignment_expected_genomic_insertion_size_threshold: 500

#For both short and long reads, we require at least junction_total_read_support_threshold supporting reads/read pairs
#before we say that there is sufficient evidence that a particular exon-exon junction is part of a retrogene
junction_total_read_support_threshold: 20

#For short reads, we additionally require junction_strong_short_read_support_threshold "strong" supporting reads/read pairs
#Strong short-read support includes an overlapping alignment (that meets overlapping requirements above), 
#or a spanning alignment with an expected genomic insertion size of at least short_read_strong_spanning_alignment_expected_genomic_insertion_size_threshold
junction_strong_short_read_support_threshold: 1
